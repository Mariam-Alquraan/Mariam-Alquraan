# Hi there, I'm Mariam Alquraan! 👋

## About Me

I am a Business Intelligence and Data Analyst with a background in Business Information Technology. I focus on analyzing sales, marketing, and eCommerce data to generate insights that support strategic and operational decision-making.

I have practical experience working with Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to perform data analysis, build dashboards, and track business performance metrics such as revenue, conversion rates, and customer behavior.

I am interested in BI roles where data is used to optimize business performance, particularly in sales, marketing, and digital commerce environments, both in Jordan and remotely.
